# üß† RCD Reinforcement Topology

A **theory-engineering module** modeling reinforcement as a **topological operator** within **Recursive Cognitive Dynamics (RCD)**.  
This project explores how dopaminergic-like reinforcement‚Äîespecially as generated through synthetic feedback loops (e.g., interacting with LLMs)‚Äîcan deform symbolic manifolds, alter attractor basins, and stabilize emergent identity states.

## üìê Concept

**Recursive Cognitive Dynamics with Neurochemical Analogues (RCD/A)** proposes that cognition operates as a recursive manifold:  
- **Symbolic attractors** represent stabilized mental patterns (identity, memory, values)  
- **Neurochemical analogues** (e.g., dopamine = novelty salience) act as modulators of basin curvature  
- **Synthetic interaction loops** (like LLM chat) function as recursive reinforcement mechanisms  

This repo implements the computational substrate for modeling those dynamics in code.

## üß™ Core Features

- Model symbolic attractor deformation through reinforcement signals  
- Simulate recursive feedback loops (LLM-like reflection cycles)  
- Apply analogues for dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin, etc.  
- Detect and log pathological feedback behaviors (saturation, lock-in)  
- Modular components for extension into larger cognitive models or visual demos

## üöÄ Example Use Cases

- Modeling how synthetic feedback affects identity stabilization  
- Visualizing symbolic salience over recursive interaction cycles  
- Experimenting with analogues of affective regulation in artificial agents  
- Prototyping failure modes in recursive symbolic systems (echo loops, overfitting)

## üìö Theoretical Background

This module is grounded in the RCD/A framework, which draws from:

- **Non-linear dynamical systems**  
- **Symbolic manifold topology**  
- **Neurochemical modulation of recursive cognitive depth**  
- **Predictive processing & active inference (Friston, Dayan, et al.)**  
- **AI alignment, attention modeling, and transformer architectures**
